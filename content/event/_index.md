title: We are Hiring!
---
  The Quad Lab is an enthusiastic group of scholars interested in research in developmental cognitive science! We believe in the importance of fostering an inclusive and supportive environment, and actively work to create such an environment. Lab members can expect that I (the PI) will be organized, supportive, open-minded, and provide clear lines of communication. When I fall short of these expectations, I am open to and encourage feedback. In return, my expectation is that all lab members are also organized, supportive, open-minded, and provide clear lines of communication both with me and other lab members.  
  
  **Postdoctoral Scholars**
  
  We are looking to hire a postdoc beginning Summer or Fall 2024!  

  Candidates must have a Ph.D. in Cognitive Science, Psychology, Human Development, or a related field by appointment start date. Additionally, competitive candidates should demonstrate: 

- Experience and comfort working with children (not necessarily in a research setting, though that is preferred); 

- Good interpersonal and teaching skills, to mentor and support a team of undergraduate students; 

- Strong communication and writing skills; 

- Experience with (or an ability to learn) R, Python, PsychoPy, jsPsych, and/or Lookit. Experience with one or more of these tools is preferred, but candidates with a demonstrated ability to learn new skills quickly (and particularly to learn quantitative/coding skills) may be considered, even without prior experience with these specific tools. 

  Please reach out if you are interested or view the job posting listed [here](https://jobs.rutgers.edu/postings/215293).

  **Graduate Students**
  
The deadline for the 2024-2025 academic year has passed. We will most likely be considering applications for the 2025-2026 academic year, which will have a deadline of Dec 1. You can learn more about the Psychology Graduate Program [here](https://psych.rutgers.edu/academics/graduate/graduate-program-overview#areas-of-study). Students in my lab are expected specialize in [Cognitive Psychology](https://psych.rutgers.edu/academics/graduate/co), and can optionally pursue a certificate in [Cognitive Science](https://ruccs.rutgers.edu/academics/graduate/graduate-certificate).
  
  **Undergraduate Research Assistants**
  
There are many ways to get involved in our research as an undergraduate at Rutgers. All undergraduates are expected to attend weekly lab meetings, meetings with your project lead and/or the PI, and to work in person in our lab on Busch campus.  

We have a central application system for tracking all undergraduate research assistants, so if you are interested please complete this form with your Rutgers email address:
