  **Graduate Students**
  
  We are accepting graduate students this cycle, to begin in Fall 2025?
  
  **Undergraduate Research Assistants**
  
  If you are an undergraduate looking to get involved in research, we are always accepting more RAs. Right now we are not recruiting anyone with a particular skill set, we are just looking for some students to help run experiments and code data. We expect you to attend weekly lab meetings, attend meetings with your project lead, and be in person working in the lab for all tasks that you are assigned to complete. If you sign up for research for credit in psychology 1 credit hour is 3 hours with a minimum of 2 credits a semester.
