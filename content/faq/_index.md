<p style="font-size: 20px">Do I have to drive to Rutgers to participate in a study?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px">Not necessarily! While many of our studies do take place in person, we have a wide variety of studies that can be done over Zoom or are primarily run online.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px">If I fill out the Qualtrics form, am I agreeing to have my child participate in a study?</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20px">No! Filling out the Qualtrics form lets us know that you are potentially interested in taking part in a study. When you or your child are eligible to participate in a study, we will reach out to you again and if you are not interested you can either say no not at the moment or ask to be removed from our list of potential participants entirely.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px">What does participating in a study entail?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px">This can differ depending on the study, but normally you will schedule a time for your child to meet with one of our research assistants (either on Zoom or in person) and they will reach out to you with a reminder the day before. At the time of the session your child will participate in a variety of activities that help us gain a deeper understanding of how they reason about proportions and other mathematical concepts. This typically includes looking at pictures and answering questions about them.</p>
