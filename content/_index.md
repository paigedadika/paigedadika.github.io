      The <span style="color:gray">**Quantitative Development Lab**</span>  is a developmental cognitive science research lab at Rutgers University, affiliated with both the Rutgers Center for Cognitive Science (RuCCs) and the Department of Psychology. Our mission is to gain a deeper understanding about the cognitive processes that drive our ability to reason about and use mathematical information throughout infancy, childhood, and into adulthood.
