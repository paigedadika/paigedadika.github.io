We are excited to hear you’re interested in our studies! We have different kinds of studies for kids at different ages, but not all studies or study types will be available all the time. A list of our currently available studies is listed below in the Active Research Studies section.

Some of our studies take place on our partnership website, [Children Helping Science](https://lookit.mit.edu). For these studies, you can participate anytime and from anywhere that you’d like without a researcher present and without needing to schedule a time. Other studies happen at scheduled times with a researcher, either remotely over video chat or at our in-person lab in the Psychology building on Rutgers University’s Busch campus. If you have other questions about participating in our studies, check out our FAQ!

## Do babies pay attention to ratios?

**Ages:** 6 month old babies

In this study, your baby will sit in a high chair or on your lap and look at pictures of orange and blue shapes. The proportion of shapes that are orange will be different in some pictures. We will measure how long your baby looks at each picture. 

**Purpose:** The purpose of this study is to better understand how children reason about numbers. Specifically, this study is about how babies think about ratios like “there are twice as many orange dots as blue dots.” We do this by showing babies pictures of different ratios and measuring how long they pay attention when seeing the same ratio over and over again or a new ratio they haven’t seen yet. For example, “6 orange and 3 blue” is the same ratio as “10 orange and 5 blue” because both are “twice as many orange” but “8 orange and 2 blue” is a new ratio (four times as many orange as blue). We also compare the looking behavior of babies who see color ratios within a single rectangle and babies who see color ratios within a set of dots. Research like this helps us understand babies’ earliest number and math abilities, which helps us learn how math concepts like fractions and counting develop.
